#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "hello World" << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}

// How C++ works
/*We write it in human language
    and the compiler converts it to byte __code_model_32__

#include <iostream> is a preprocessor statement

Return type for main f() function is 0, even if you dont write it 
Header files doesnt get comoiled, only code within main or other function gets compiled
Header file is compiles by include
